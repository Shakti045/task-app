1. **Time Spent:** I spent around 1-1.5 hours on the coding test, focusing on clean and optimized code.  

2. **Most Useful Feature in React 19:** React 19 introduces the **React Compiler**, which automatically optimizes components by memoizing them to reduce unnecessary re-renders. However, I haven’t used React 19 yet because it is not stable currently and is causing errors with the dependencies I’m using. As a result, I’ve managed optimizations on my own for the time being. 

3. **Tracking Performance Issues in Production:** I would analyze **React Profiler, Chrome DevTools, network requests, and logs** to detect bottlenecks. I have debugged performance issues before by optimizing API calls and state management.  

4. **Additional Features & Improvements:**  
   - **Drag-and-drop task reordering** for better UX.  
   - **Recurring tasks** for automation.  
   - **Task assignments & collaboration** for teams.  
   - **Offline mode** using IndexedDB.  
   - **Push notifications** for important deadlines.
